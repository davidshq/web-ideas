# Lowering the Barrier to Entry for "Productive" Development

# Introduction
My first computer was a Commodore 64 that upon boot dropped me to a command prompt that ran BASIC. Soon thereafter I'd find my way to the Apple II series which offered the same experience. Microsoft's DOS didn't offer BASIC at the command line but some variant of BASIC (most famously QBasic) came bundled with the system and with later Windows systems as well.

When I became a (relatively) early internet adopter the ISP I used (AOL) bundled web hosting with internet access and creating pages that others would actually read could be accomplished in straight HTML. Over time tidbits of CSS and JavaScript became useful too.

The barrier to entry was low, the tools were free,[1] and the time to working results was minimal. Not anymore.

# Don't Want to Go Back
I'm not stuck in a nostalgic past, I don't want to return to those old ways because the "things" we created (applications, pages, etc.) were much more limited than those we can build today. That said, I do think we have a real issue with being approachable. 

While we have more powerful systems with more tools enabling rapid development and far more resources from which to learn, this has not made:

(a) it easier for individuals to get started in development beyond the basics ("Hello World", todo list, etc.)
or
(b) allow hobbyists/casual developers to create more innovative solutions (with their constrained resources - e.g. time, people)

We need a better way to get folks from beginning developer to productive developer.

# What to Do?
There are several ways in which we could simplify the barriers to new/casual/hobbyist developers.[2] I'd like to propose three paths forward (none exclusive to the others):

- [1. A Conceptual Subset](/lower-barrier-to-entry/conceptual-subset.md)
- [2. A Bidirectional Transpilation Tool.](/lower-barrier-to-entry/bidirectional-transpilation-tool.md)
- [3. Simplified Prepackaged Development Environments](/lower-barrier-to-entry/simplified-development-environment.md).

# Conclusion
I'm not married to these particular methods of simplifying development but I do think we owe it to the community to provide better ways to learn and create without the necessity of full-time education or employment in the field.

Signing off my heretical thoughts, send me back your snide remarks or kudos!

# Footnotes
[1]Interestingly, for those working with a Microsoft stack that where quite lean without the free tooling. I'm specifically thinking of the initial launch of Visual Basic when there was no free IDE / integrated build too available. It took me quite a while to save up my pennies and buy a student license for VB back then.
[2]At one time I thought the path forward might be a new development stack, or at least a new domain specific langauge (DSL) within an existing development stack. But the proliferation of languages and tools has made me doubt the wisdom of this approach.
