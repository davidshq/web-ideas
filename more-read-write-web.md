# The Need for a More Read/Write Web
There are several problems the web faces which could be mitigated through improving the read/write layer of the web.

## Problem 1: Content Quality
Many individuals write good articles on various topics but have some spelling, grammatical, or other errors. Right now there is no easy/quick way for an individual to report these errors to the webmaster. Sure an email works, but if you are looking to provide feedback in any volume this becomes a chore.[1]

## Problem 2: Content Aging
Great articles are written and over time they age. Folks may begin to look for newer articles on a topic even if the older article is still current. What if there was a way for the author (and others) to reflect whether the article was still current?

We seem some of this with blog articles having "Last Updated" dates...but let's go further.

## Problem 3: Content Authority
Individuals without credentials in a particular field can be the most knowledgable on a subject. Yet, right now, there is not a great way for viewers to know that the author is knowledgable and reliable if they don't have some sort of academic, employment, etc. credentials.

What if we could allow users to lend their voice as credence for an article's authority?

## Problem 4: Content Abandonment
There is little incentive for sites to maintain old content rather than create new content. New content gets new viewers. Look at most technical sites and you will find the same topic addressed multiple times in fairly identical ways across a long time span. Why? Because there is not an incentive for the author/owner to update the older article rather than replacing it.

What if we could provide a way that older content could receive the same traffic boost that newer content receives? Then authors would be encouraged to maintain older content rather than writing newer content.

## Proposed Solution Yet To Come...
I have a proposed solution...coming soon. =)
