# Proposal: Web Maintenance Organization
Almost everyone has encountered it - a dependency that has grown old and stale yet remains a fundamental part of numerous production systems. If you install almost any popular node.js package you'll see at least several warnings flash on your screen as npm warns you that variously dependencies have been discontinued, that new options are recommended, that severe security vulnerabilities have been discovered.

We have seen how little recognized but critically important open source software can cause significant vulnerabilities when patches are not issued quickly enough...and the next great exploit is always just around the corner.

Organizations like [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/) have done some innovative and worthwhile work on this front by helping OSS developers get paid for their work -- allowing them to spend more than an hour here or there on nights and weekends on their projects. Hopefully this movement will continue to grow - I'd love to see many more OSS developers able to work full-time on the projects they love and we depend on.

But this still leaves us with a significant amount of unmaintained software. Software where the original maintainer has abandoned the project OR where the maintainer cannot allocate additional time to the project even with additional funding. So I'd like to propose a web maintenance organization. It would consist of several full-time developers who would not be committed to a single project but instead would work on numerous projects creating important patches.

It could be organized as a non-profit and have an oversight board that helped determine the projects which should receive attention and with what urgency the attention is required. The organization might also have some funds it could utilize to hire contractors to perform work which would be overseen and reviewed by the full-time staff of the organization.

# Thoughts?
I know this is pretty bare bones. What questions or comments do you have that I can use to flesh out this proposal?
