# Web Ideas
They say everyone has ideas, its all about bringing those ideas to fruition. [Grant for the Web](https://www.grantfortheweb.org/) may offer a way for more of us to see those ideas we just don't quite have time to implement become a reality.

This repository consists of ideas I'd love to work on implementing related to improving the web for everyone.

## Bare Bone Proposals
These are relatively sparse proposals which I think are worth sharing but would require significant fleshing out to see a sucessful implementation.
- [Web Maintenance Organization](https://github.com/davidshq/web-ideas/blob/master/web-maintenance.md) - A team of developers who would focus on improving important web software that would otherwise go unmaintained (and potentially vulnerable to security threats).
- [Reducing Barrier to Entry](https://github.com/davidshq/web-ideas/blob/master/lower-barrier-to-entry.md) - Creating websites and web applications is not a simple undertaking. We need to lower barriers to entry to ensure that new/casual/hobbyist individuals can participate in creating valuable content and applications in resource constrained environments.
