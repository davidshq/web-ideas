# Web Ideas
They say everyone has ideas, its all about bringing those ideas to fruition. [Grant for the Web](https://www.grantfortheweb.org/) may offer a way for more of us to see those ideas we just don't quite have time to implement become a reality.

This repository consists of ideas I'd love to work on implementing related to improving the web for everyone.
